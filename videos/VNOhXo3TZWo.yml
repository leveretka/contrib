title: 'GeeCON 2019: Marharyta Nedzelska  - Rediscovering gRPC with Kotlin coroutines'
recordingDate: 1563984135
description: 'Microservice architecture is now a huge trend. All big organizations with millions of users are doing microservices. This means they have lots of channels of communication between services and need to send and get much data. At some point, you can find yourself in a situation where your current approach doesn’t provide you with efficient communications, you pay more, wait for more, lose more etc. Maybe it’s time to look at gRPC… gRPC is asynchronous by its nature. But old api, java infrastructure, and verbosity make people write lots of noise and break their beautiful minds to make things done. In Kotlin we have awesome coroutines concept. So async gRPC and coroutines could be a perfect match! Let’s discover if this is possible. In this talk, we’ll learn how to build microservices using gRPC with minimum pain. We’ ll discuss the pros and cons of this approach, what can be improved, what should be added. In this talk we''ll cover some basics of gRPC, and it''s usage in jvm. We''ll look at java old-fashioned style and then switch to a modern and lovely Kotlin style.'
