description: 'Microservice architecture is now a huge trend. All big organizations with millions of users are doing microservices. This means they have lots of channels of communication between services and need to send and get much data. At some point, you can find yourself in a situation where your current approach doesn’t provide you with efficient communications, you pay more, wait for more, lose more etc. Maybe it’s time to look at gRPC… In this talk, we will cover the basics of gRPC, protocol buffers, and its usage. We will try to understand its pros and cons and where this approach could be used. We will also compare this approach with the alternatives. The most interesting about this talk is that we will have lots of practice. We will learn how to write .proto files, how to make effective communication between your microservices, and of course, write much code (in Kotlin)'
